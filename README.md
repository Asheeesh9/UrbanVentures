## 🧾Common Rules:

- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The mentors will evaluate the submissions and assign points for each specific task based on a variety of design-related factors, such as the use of design thinking, the authenticity of the idea, the submission's visual attractiveness, etc. The points will be distributed as follows:
    
    🥇1st Place :   Full Points
    
    🥈2nd Place :   0.8 * Full Points
    
    🥉3rd Place :   0.5 * Full Points
    
- Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the rest of the participants who qualify for the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)** as mentioned in the respective folders of the task will be awarded 0.3 * Full Points🎉.
- These tasks are for learning design and not just scoring points so any kind of Plagiarism or attempt thereof wouldn't be tolerated and would lead to disqualification from OpenCode. You can always ping us for doubts and we would be more than happy to help but simply copying others' ideas for the sake of completing the tasks will be dealt strictly with.
